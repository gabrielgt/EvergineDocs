# Create assets
In **Evergine** there are two ways of creating an asset depending on its type :
* Importing a **resource file** to the **Assets Details** panel, either with _drag and drop_ or selecting the **Import asset** menu item. This works with images, 3d models and sound files.
* Creating an asset directly from **Evergine Studio**. Only for non resource and **Evergine** specifics assets.

## Metafile generation
When creating an asset, a **Metafile** will be generated with the same name of the resource file. That file will contains all the properties and profile specifications of the asset. Every asset type has a different extension, described below.

## Importing assets

### Drag and drop the resource file

You can drag any file into the **Evergine Studio** to import that asset file into the project and create an asset with it. Depending of the file extension **Evergine Studio** will decide what kind of asset will be created in the panel folder:

| Asset type | Metafile extension | Supported file extensions| 
|-----------|--------|-------------|---------|
| Texture | `.wetx` | `.jpg `, `.jpeg `, `.png `, `.bmp `, `.tga `, `.ktx `, `.dds `, `.hdr` |
| Model | `.wemd` |  `.gltf `, `.glb `, `.fbx `, `.3ds `, `.obj `, `.dxf `, `.dae` |
| Sound | `.wesn` |  `.wav `, `.mp3 `, `.ogg` | 
| File | `.wefile` |  Any other file. 

Import an asset by dragging and dropping a resource file from your _File Explorer_ to the **Assets Detail** panel.

### Use the import asset menu item

You can also import a resource file selecting the **Import Asset** menu item located in:

* In the **Assets** main menu.
* In the ![Plus Icon](images/plusIcon.jpg) button on the **Assets Details** panel.
* The **Asset Details** panel contextual menu.

## Create assets without resource file.

**Evergine** uses a variety of assets that don't require external resource files. Those assets can be created directly from the **Evergine Studio**. 
Like in the previous section, you can access the Assets menu items in three places: 

* In the **Assets** item in the main menu.
* In the ![Plus Icon](images/plusIcon.jpg) button on the **Assets Details** panel.
* In the **Assets Details** contextual menu.

This way we can create the following assets:

| Asset type | Metafile extension | Additional files |
|------------|--------------------|------------------|
| Scene | `.wesc` | `.wescene` file with the scene elements. A folder with the scene name that contains Scene subassets like the environment probe. |
| Effect _(graphic effect and compute shader)_| `.wefx` | `Sources` folder, containing a `Shader.fx` file with the shader description |
| Sampler | `.wesp` |
| Material | `.wemt` |
| Render Layer | `.werl` |
| Post-Processing Graph | `.wepp` |

> [!NOTE]
> If there is already an asset with the same name than the importing resource file, the new asset will be renamed adding a number suffix in the name. 
> For example,  _texture.jpg_ would be renamed to _texture(1).jpg_ and _texture(2).jpg_ if another file with the same name is imported.
