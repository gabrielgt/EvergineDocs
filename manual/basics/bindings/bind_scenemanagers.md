# Bind SceneManagers

Using **[BindSceneManager]** attribute allows the developer to stablish dependencies with a [SceneManager](../scenes/scenemanagers.md) registered in the Scene. 

```csharp
// Bind the RenderManager of the scene...
[BindSeneManager]
private RenderManager renderManager;
```

> [!NOTE]
> [BindSceneManager] can be used inside Components and SceneManagers. In other case the binding cannot be resolved

## [BindSceneManager] Properties
This attribute offers several ways to customize:

### IsRequired (default `true`)

If the value is true the dependency is required to be resolved, in other case, the current Component won't be attached.

The IsRequired value has the same functionality than [BindComponent] (see [Bind Components](bind_components.md for further details)).

For example, if this is all Services registered inside the Application Container:

```csharp
this.managers.AddManager(new EntityManager());
this.managers.AddManager(new AssetSceneManager());
this.managers.AddManager(new BehaviorManager());
this.managers.AddManager(new RenderManager());
this.managers.AddManager(new EnvironmentManager());
```

The following component will be attached because the `EnvironmentManager` has been registered:

```csharp
public class MyComponent : Component
{
    [BindSceneManager]
    private EnvironmentManager environmentManager;

    // ...
}
```

However, in that case, the dependency will fail because `PhyisicManager3D`  is not registered in the scene:

```csharp
public class MyComponent : Component
{
    [BindSceneManager]
    private PhyisicManager3D physicManager;

    // ...
}
```
